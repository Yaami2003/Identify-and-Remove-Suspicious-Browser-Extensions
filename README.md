# Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions
## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to review, identify, and safely remove browser extensions that may pose security or privacy risks.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Google Chrome (chrome://extensions)

## 📝 What I Did
1. Opened Chrome's Extensions Manager.
2. Reviewed installed extensions and permissions.
3. Found that "McAfee WebAdvisor":
- Had broad permissions (read and change data on all sites)
- Was added by a third-party (potentially bundled without full consent)
4. Removed "McAfee WebAdvisor" due to privacy concerns.
5. Retained only the "Google Docs Offline" extension.
6. Restarted the browser and confirmed removal.

## 📷 Screenshots
